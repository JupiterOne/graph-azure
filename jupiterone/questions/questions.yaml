    title: Are there any guest users with access to Azure?
    description:
      Azure AD is extended to include Azure AD B2B collaboration, allowing you
      to invite people from outside your organization to be guest users in your
      cloud account and sign in with their own work, school, or social
      identities. Guest users allow you to share your company's applications and
      services with users from any other organization, while maintaining control
      over your own corporate data.\n\nWork with external partners, large or
      small, even if they don't have Azure AD or an IT department. A simple
      invitation and redemption process lets partners use their own credentials
      to access your company's resources a a guest user.
