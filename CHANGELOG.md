## 4.0.0 - 2020-06-30

This release is a complete restructuring of the program to move to the new
JupiterOne integration SDK. Benefits are numerous, including:

- Use the latest patterns and allow for much easier advancement of the
  integration in all the ways intended by the new SDK
- Break work into more atomic steps, particularly helpful for database ingestion
- Allow for ingesting as much data as possible even when some data cannot be
  retrieved (partial sets)
- Significantly better error reporting, and statistics are collected
- Designed to run as a single process, dramatically simplifying deployments

## 3.16.3 - 2020-05-18

### Changed

- Filter out empty string in array list returned by Azure API on SQL Server
  auditing and alerting settings.

## 3.16.2 - 2020-05-18

### Changed

- Changed SQL server `alertAll` property to `alertOnAllThreats`.

## 3.16.1 - 2020-05-18

### Changed

- Set SQL server `alertAll: alertingEnabled && !hasDisabledAlerts`.

## 3.16.0 - 2020-05-18

### Added

- SQL Server and Database auditing status and properties.
- SQL Server alerting status and properties.

## 3.15.7 - 2020-05-17

### Added

- `attached` boolean and `state` property on `azure_managed_disk` entities.

## 3.15.6 - 2020-05-17

### Fixed

- Incorrect parsing the `targetPortRanges` (`fromPort` and `toPort`) of an Azure
  Security Group rule.

## 3.15.5 - 2020-05-06

### Changed

- Upgrade `@jupiterone/integration-sdk` to version `33.7.5`.

## 3.15.4 - 2020-05-06

### Added

- Logging in DB synchronization code, since there is so much going on in one
  step, cannot see how far it gets before failing.

## 3.15.3 - 2020-05-04

### Fixed

- SDK bug in `IntegrationCache.putEntries` that would duplicate keys and
  continually expand the keyspace, leading to infinite looping.

## 3.15.2 - 2020-05-04

### Added

- Log more details during group member fetching, group iteration.

## 3.15.1 - 2020-05-04

### Fixed

- NPM package for 3.15.0 has no `dist` directory, cannot import code.

## 3.15.0 - 2020-04-24

### Fixed

- Users are not related to groups of which they are a member.

### Added

- `encrypted` property on storage services (`azure_storage_*_service`).

- Key Vault resources: `azure_keyvault_service` (not yet loading keys, certs)

### Fixed

- Virtual networks listing sometimes produces a `502` server response. This
  would crash Compute synchronization. Virtual network sync is skipped in this
  case so other synchronization carries on.

- `_type` for images and disks was incorrect so that ingestion may have been
  unstable.

## 3.13.0 - 2020-04-17

### Added

- Additional properties on `azure_storage_*_service` entities: `kind`,
  `enableHttpsTrafficOnly`.

  service encryption setting.

## 3.12.0 - 2020-04-16

### Added

- Storage resources: `azure_storage_file_service`, `azure_storage_share`
